This folder contains scripts used to detect DEG for plant materials from snow mold inoculation 

Sampling points: 

1. Before plants going into the cold room for acclimation before inoculation
2. 1 hour after acclimated in cold room, before inoculating pathogen
3. 12 hours after the snow mold inoculation 

Objectives for each sampling point:
1. to check what/if plant behave differently under greenhouse condition (TP3)
2. to check after one hour of cold treatment, what genes have been up/down regulated (TP4)
3. to check if some new genes are activated (in NR but was not at significant level eariler) (TP5)
